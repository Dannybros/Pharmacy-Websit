                    Credit cards allow customers to borrow funds from a bank and either pay the balance in full each month or pay the money back with interest. Debit cards make payments by deducting money directly from a customer‘s checking account, rather than using a line of credit. <br/><br/>

                    We are using Stripe Payment gateway to validate your credit card and also keep your private info safe when purchasing our medicine. Stripe was founded in 2010 with the mission of making it easier to accept payments over the internet. At the time, taking credit cards meant working with a legacy processor or a middleman broker who would provide you with access to a processor.

                    Cash is legal tender—currency or coins—that can be used to exchange goods, debt, or services. Sometimes it also includes the value of assets that can be easily converted into cash immediately, as reported by a company.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    Ultimately, individuals use a mix of both cash and credit cards for different kinds of purchases. While paying in cash will most likely help you save money and make fewer impulse purchases, paying in credit cards does offer an enviable convenience and allow you to afford larger items—given you monitor your spending carefully and make sure to pay off your balance each month.
                    <br/> <br/>
                    With cash, your spending is straightforward and there is less risk of identity theft. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to make the best decisions based on their financial health, what they are purchasing, and the risks they are willing to incur.

                    BCEL ONE PAY is one of the most used and popular online money transfer app in Laos. Unfortunately, We still haven't registered for BCEL Bank Payment Gateway to verify whether you have paid or not. <b>If you wish to pay with BCEL ONE PAY, then Please choose option "Cash" when purchasing and do the transaction with Deliverymen. </b>
